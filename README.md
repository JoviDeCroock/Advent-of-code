# Advent of code 2019

The advent of code is a yearly thing where you get daily coding challenges, no need for a cs degree
problem solving skills will be tested though.

I aim at making every coding challenge in a different language and aim at documenting this well so people
can learn from it.

Happy holidays everyone!

If you want to participate in the [Advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/).
